# Python {#sec-python}

The recommended version for most users is 3.11.9. A higher version will work
fine, but cause a very long installation time for packages (like this one)
which is based on Python 3.8.

## Install

### Windows & macOS

The main download page can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Direct download links for version 3.11.9:

- [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe)
- [macOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-macos11.pkg)

### Linux

Linux users should install Python using their distribution's package manager.
Installing a specific version is more complicated, so we'll keep it simple and
use the latest version. On Ubuntu that would be:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

## Test installation

You can now test that Python is working by entering the following in a terminal,

```bash
python --version
```

which should output `Python 3.x.x`.

If you get a "command not found" error, then:

1. Make sure you typed it correctly.
2. Some distributions don't include the `python` alias. Try using `python3`
   directly, like this: `python3 --version`.

## Setup Pip

(Replace `python`/`pip` with `python3`/`pip3` as needed.)

Pip should be bundled with python. Ensure that it's working by running:

```bash
pip --version
```

If it's not working, then try the following:

```bash
python -m ensurepip
```

Lastly, upgrade pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
